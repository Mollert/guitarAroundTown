				<p class="bioText">There I was, with plenty of time on my hands.  It was the first of February 2020.  I thought it might be fun to learn to play the guitar.  I’ve always loved music, especially from an acoustic guitar.  I had the time.  Little did I know that fate would be giving me more home time than I ever thought.  I had about three in person lessons before we went virtual.  So with so much time, all I could do was practice.  I really came to like the whole process.  I’d practice all week and then get set straight during my weekly lesson.</p>
				<p class="bioText">As I progressed, I thought of songs that I wanted to play.  I looked up the chords and tried them out.  Some worked, some not so much, and some I just wasn’t ready to tackle. My library started to expand and the singing aspect started to come into play.  That was something that I never expected.  I’ve sung in the shower and in the car along with songs, but singing alone while playing the music, well that’s a whole new experience!  I self-recorded some songs, but really don’t like my voice.  My teacher says as long as you are on pitch, you will do fine.  Don’t think you are going to sound like the original artist.  You are you.  Still, I have a tough time with my voice.</p>
				<p class="bioText">I still practice a lot being I’ve seen the progress (but of course, the simple stuff comes easy and the harder stuff comes a little bit slower).  The bottom line is:  I still enjoy it and have experienced a sense of what it is to be an entertainer, which is new to me.  I started playing at random places around town.  I tried downtown but it is way too noisy.  I’ve played in parks, strip malls, farmers markets, and along retail sidewalks.  It’s fun to see people clap, give me a thumbs up, or even yell out “rock on!”.  With that positive reinforcement, I continue to add songs, refine my technique, and have fun all along the way.</p>
				<p class="bioText">My guitar is a solid wood Seagull, made in a small town in eastern Quebec, Canada close to the border of Maine and Vermont.  They have been making guitars since 1982.  For my ear, it sounds great when being played softly or strong.  I am still working on how the strings affect the music.  What I need now is to further develop my ear.</p>
