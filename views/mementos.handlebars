				<p>This sketch was given to me by a young lady who sat in her car with her window open while I sang a couple of songs. I thought she was just drinking her coffee but when I was done she walked over and handed this sketch to me saying "you made my day".</p>
				<p>I felt the same way.</p>

				<p>I finished playing at a farmers market and a lady came up to me and asked if I would stop by her stand before I left. She said she wanted to show her appreciation for entertaining her and her customers and gave me a trout fillet from their trout farm.</p>
				<p>Good eatin'.</p>

				<p>A lady came out of a store that I was playing next to and said "glad to see you today". She later came back with this cup of brickle sweets. Yum! It was full at the time but before I could take a picture, I tried some. A little more than some it looks like.</p>
				<p>Thank you!</p>

				<p>Doesn't sound like much, but after you've been singing for over an hour, a cold drink of water is exactly what you need. So next time you see a street performer, keep them going by quenching their thirst.</p>
				<p>You will ultimately hear the difference.</p>
